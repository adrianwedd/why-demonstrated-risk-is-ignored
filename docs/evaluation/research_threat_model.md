## Purpose

This document anticipates risks to research participants and researchers. It is designed to be expanded into an ethics appendix when field research begins.

## Risk Categories

### R1: Retaliation Risk

**Description:** Participants who provide information about organisational risk management may face negative consequences from their organisation.

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Participant identified by organisation | Medium | High | High |
| Information traced back to individual | Medium | High | High |
| Organisation retaliates against participant | Low-Medium | High | Medium-High |

**Mitigations:**

| Mitigation | Implementation | Residual Risk |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Anonymisation | Remove identifying information before analysis | Medium — some contexts identifiable |
| Aggregation | Report only aggregate findings, not individual cases | Low |
| Confidentiality agreement | Researcher commits to not disclosing sources | Low |
| Informed consent | Participant understands risks before participation | N/A — transferred risk |
| Opt-out mechanism | Participant can withdraw data at any point | Low |

**Monitoring:**
- Check in with participants periodically during study
- Establish secure communication channel for concerns
- Document any reported retaliation incidents

**Response Actions:**
- If retaliation suspected: pause data collection from that source
- If retaliation confirmed: exclude organisation from study; support participant
- If pattern emerges: halt study; consult ethics board

### R2: Legal Discovery Risk

**Description:** Research data could be subject to legal discovery in litigation, exposing participants or organisations.

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Research data subpoenaed | Low | High | Medium |
| Data reveals actionable negligence | Low | Very High | Medium-High |
| Participant testimony compelled | Very Low | High | Low-Medium |

**Mitigations:**

| Mitigation | Implementation | Residual Risk |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Data minimisation | Collect only necessary data; destroy raw data after analysis | Low |
| Aggregation | Report only aggregate findings | Low |
| Anonymisation | No individual or organisation identifiable in stored data | Low |
| Jurisdictional planning | Store data in jurisdiction with researcher protections | Low |
| Certificate of Confidentiality | Obtain legal protection where available | Very Low |

**Monitoring:**
- Consult with legal counsel before data collection
- Monitor for any legal actions involving participating organisations
- Review data retention policies regularly

**Response Actions:**
- If subpoena received: consult legal counsel immediately; assert available protections
- If data may be exposed: notify affected participants; invoke destruction protocols

### R3: Reputational Harm Risk

**Description:** Published findings could harm the reputation of participating organisations or the research community.

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Organisation identified in negative finding | Medium | High | High |
| Findings misrepresented in media | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Research quality questioned | Low | High | Medium |

**Mitigations:**

| Mitigation | Implementation | Residual Risk |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Anonymisation | No organisation identifiable in publications | Low |
| Member checking | Share findings with participants before publication | Low |
| Balanced reporting | Report both positive and negative findings | Low |
| Context provision | Ensure findings include necessary context | Low |
| Prepublication review | Allow participants to flag factual errors | Very Low |

**Monitoring:**
- Track media coverage of publications
- Monitor participant concerns post-publication
- Document any reputational issues reported

**Response Actions:**
- If misrepresentation occurs: issue correction; clarify findings
- If organisation harmed: work with organisation on response
- If research quality questioned: provide data and methods transparently

### R4: Accidental Disclosure Risk

**Description:** Research data could be accidentally disclosed through security breach, human error, or technical failure.

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data breach | Low | High | Medium |
| Accidental email/sharing | Medium | High | High |
| Technical failure exposing data | Low | Medium | Low-Medium |

**Mitigations:**

| Mitigation | Implementation | Residual Risk |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Encryption | Encrypt data at rest and in transit | Low |
| Access control | Limit access to research team only | Low |
| Training | Train team on data handling procedures | Low |
| Secure infrastructure | Use institutional secure storage | Low |
| Audit logging | Log all access to sensitive data | Very Low |

**Monitoring:**
- Regular security audits of data storage
- Review access logs periodically
- Test data handling procedures

**Response Actions:**
- If breach detected: notify affected participants within 72 hours
- If accidental disclosure: assess scope; notify affected parties; document
- If technical failure: restore from backup; investigate root cause

### R5: Researcher Safety Risk

**Description:** Researcher could face negative consequences for findings that challenge powerful interests.

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Professional retaliation | Low | Medium | Low-Medium |
| Legal action against researcher | Very Low | High | Low |
| Personal harassment | Very Low | Medium | Low |

**Mitigations:**

| Mitigation | Implementation | Residual Risk |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Institutional support | Conduct research with institutional backing | Low |
| Legal consultation | Understand legal exposure before publication | Low |
| Peer review | Ensure findings are defensible through review | Low |
| Documentation | Maintain clear research records | Very Low |

**Monitoring:**
- Document any concerns or threats received
- Maintain contact with institutional research office
- Monitor for any legal or professional actions

**Response Actions:**
- If threat received: document; consult institution; consider law enforcement
- If legal action: engage institutional legal support
- If professional retaliation: document; engage professional associations
