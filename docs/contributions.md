## Overview

This work makes three distinct contributions to understanding why organisations fail to act on demonstrated risk. Unlike descriptive case studies that document failures, this work provides:

1. An **explanatory model** of why inaction is structurally rational
2. A **taxonomy of structural inhibitors** that can be operationally identified
3. **Governance intervention patterns** that target specific failure modes

Each contribution is grounded in existing literature and practical experience, not field data. The claims are designed to be empirically testable in future work.

## Contribution 1: Explanatory Model

> **We provide a socio-technical model explaining why ignoring demonstrated risk is often the locally rational choice for individual actors, even when it is globally harmful to the organisation.**

### What this claim means

The model explains *why* inaction occurs, not merely *that* it occurs. The core insight is that organisational structures create incentive landscapes where:

- Surfacing risk creates personal liability
- Acting on risk requires resources the actor doesn't control
- Ignoring risk preserves the status quo and avoids immediate political cost
- Deniability is a form of organisational currency

### How this differs from prior work

| Prior work | This contribution |
|------------|-------------------|
| Describes failures after the fact | Explains the structural conditions that make failure predictable |
| Focuses on individual psychology (bias, denial) | Focuses on systemic incentives and authority structures |
| Treats inaction as irrational or negligent | Treats inaction as locally rational given structural constraints |
| Prescribes cultural change ("be more safety-conscious") | Prescribes structural change (redesign incentives, authority, accountability) |

### Grounding

This claim synthesises:
- Psychological safety research (Edmondson) — why voice is suppressed
- Whistleblowing literature (Miceli, Near) — costs of speaking up
- Security economics (Anderson, Arora) — rational disclosure decisions
- Normalisation of deviance (Vaughan) — how anomalies become acceptable

The contribution is the *integration* of these literatures into a unified model of truth flow through organisations.

## Contribution 2: Structural Inhibitor Taxonomy

> **We identify and operationalise four structural inhibitors — responsibility without authority, risk discovery as career threat, compliance theatre, and accountability diffusion — as distinct, observable failure modes that can be reliably coded across cases.**

### What this claim means

The taxonomy names specific structural patterns that cause demonstrated risk to stall. Each inhibitor is:

- **Defined** with clear boundaries
- **Observable** through organisational tells and artifacts
- **Mappable** to specific stages in the truth flow pipeline
- **Distinguishable** from the other inhibitors

### How this differs from prior work

| Prior work | This contribution |
|------------|-------------------|
| Lists barriers to safety culture | Provides operational definitions for coding |
| Describes symptoms (e.g., "blame culture") | Identifies structural mechanisms |
| Focuses on one inhibitor (e.g., psychological safety alone) | Integrates multiple inhibitors and their interactions |
| Requires researcher interpretation | Enables inter-rater reliability |

### Grounding

Each inhibitor draws on established research:
- Responsibility without authority: organisational design, principal-agent problems
- Risk discovery as career threat: whistleblowing research, psychological safety
- Compliance theatre: security economics, assurance vs. insurance
- Accountability diffusion: diffusion of responsibility, bystander effect literature

The contribution is *operationalisation* — converting these concepts into a usable coding instrument.

## Contribution 3: Governance Intervention Patterns

> **We derive governance intervention patterns — including mandatory response triggers, protected discovery, empirical validation requirements, and executive risk acceptance — that target specific inhibitors and can be implemented without researcher presence.**

### What this claim means

The intervention patterns are:

- **Derived from the model** — each pattern targets a specific inhibitor at a specific pipeline stage
- **Actionable** — concrete enough to implement, not just principles
- **Evaluable** — each pattern has associated metrics for assessing effectiveness
- **Failure-aware** — each pattern includes known failure modes and mitigations

### How this differs from prior work

| Prior work | This contribution |
|------------|-------------------|
| Recommends "improve safety culture" | Specifies structural mechanisms to change |
| Provides principles without implementation guidance | Provides pattern cards with context, forces, and failure modes |
| Assumes good faith implementation | Anticipates gaming and compliance theatre |
| Focuses on single interventions | Maps interventions to inhibitors for targeted deployment |

### Grounding

Patterns draw on:
- Aviation safety (protected reporting, mandatory response)
- Software security economics (disclosure incentives, bounty programs)
- Governance design patterns (RACI, escalation protocols)
- Red team/adversarial testing (empirical validation)

The contribution is *translation* — converting research insights into implementable governance designs.

## Summary Table

| Contribution | Type | Distinguishing Feature | Testable? |
|--------------|------|------------------------|-----------|
| Explanatory model | Theoretical | Explains *why* inaction is rational | Yes — via propositions |
| Inhibitor taxonomy | Instrumental | Enables reliable *coding* | Yes — via inter-rater reliability |
| Intervention patterns | Applied | Enables *implementation* without researcher | Yes — via outcome metrics |

## What This Work Is Not

To avoid overclaiming:

- **Not an empirical study:** Claims are derived from literature synthesis and practical experience, not new field data
- **Not a comprehensive framework:** Four inhibitors and five patterns are a starting point, not exhaustive
- **Not a guarantee:** Interventions may fail; this work provides hypotheses to test, not proven solutions
- **Not applicable everywhere:** Some contexts (e.g., small startups, authoritarian regimes) may have different dynamics
