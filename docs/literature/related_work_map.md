## Purpose

This document positions the current work within four related literatures. Each cluster is analysed for:
- Key papers and central claims
- What the literature explains well
- What it fails to explain (the gap this work addresses)
- Connection to structural inhibitors

## Cluster 1: Psychological Safety and Voice/Silence

### Key Papers

1. **Edmondson (1999)** — Psychological safety and learning behavior in work teams
2. **Morrison (2011)** — Employee voice and silence: A literature review
3. **Milliken, Morrison & Hewlin (2003)** — An exploratory study of employee silence
4. **Detert & Edmondson (2011)** — Implicit voice theories
5. **Van Dyne & LePine (1998)** — Helping and voice extra-role behaviors
6. **Kish-Gephart et al. (2009)** — Silenced by fear

### Central Claims

This literature establishes that:

- **Psychological safety enables voice:** When team members feel safe from interpersonal risk, they speak up about problems, ask questions, and admit errors (Edmondson, 1999)
- **Silence is a choice:** Employees actively decide to withhold information based on perceived costs and benefits (Morrison, 2011; Milliken et al., 2003)
- **Implicit theories drive self-censorship:** Even without explicit sanctions, employees hold beliefs about when speaking up is appropriate that lead to silence (Detert & Edmondson, 2011)
- **Voice is extra-role behaviour:** Speaking up goes beyond job requirements and is influenced by contextual factors (Van Dyne & LePine, 1998)
- **Fear suppresses voice:** Multiple fear sources (job loss, social rejection, punishment) create silence (Kish-Gephart et al., 2009)

### What This Literature Explains Well

| Phenomenon | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Why employees stay silent | Fear, implicit theories, perceived futility |
| Team-level variation | Psychological safety varies by team, affecting learning |
| Voice as prosocial | Speaking up benefits the organisation, not just the individual |
| Manager influence | Leader behaviour shapes team psychological safety |

### What This Literature Fails to Explain

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Career-level vs. team-level | Literature focuses on team dynamics; career incentives operate at organisational level |
| Structural vs. cultural | Literature emphasises culture/climate; less attention to structural incentives |
| Risk-specific voice | Literature treats voice generically; risk discovery may have distinct dynamics |
| Beyond voice to action | Literature explains why people don't speak; less on why organisations don't act after hearing |
| Authority gap | Literature assumes speaking up leads to action; doesn't address what happens when it doesn't |

### Connection to Inhibitors

| Inhibitor | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Risk discovery as career threat | **Direct connection:** This literature provides the psychological foundation for why risk discovery is suppressed. The gap: it focuses on team-level safety, not career-level structural incentives |
| Responsibility without authority | **Indirect connection:** Voice literature notes "perceived futility" as silence driver; this connects to authority gap but is not the primary focus |

## Cluster 2: Whistleblowing and Retaliation

### Key Papers

1. **Near & Miceli (1985)** — Organizational dissidence: The case of whistle-blowing
2. **Miceli & Near (1992)** — Blowing the whistle (book)
3. **Dozier & Miceli (1985)** — Potential predictors of whistle-blowing
4. **Mesmer-Magnus & Viswesvaran (2005)** — Whistleblowing in organizations: Meta-analysis
5. **Rehg et al. (2008)** — Antecedents and outcomes of retaliation
6. **Bjørkelo et al. (2011)** — Silence is golden?

### Central Claims

This literature establishes that:

- **Whistleblowers face retaliation:** Reporting wrongdoing leads to predictable negative consequences including termination, demotion, and isolation (Miceli & Near, 1992)
- **Retaliation is predictable:** Factors including wrongdoing severity, evidence strength, and wrongdoer power predict retaliation likelihood (Rehg et al., 2008)
- **Legal protections are insufficient:** Despite laws protecting whistleblowers, retaliation remains common (Mesmer-Magnus & Viswesvaran, 2005)
- **Personality and context interact:** Individual factors (moral reasoning, locus of control) combine with situational factors to predict whistleblowing (Dozier & Miceli, 1985)
- **Organisations benefit from whistleblowing:** Disclosure helps organisations correct problems, yet they still retaliate (Near & Miceli, 1985)

### What This Literature Explains Well

| Phenomenon | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Why people don't report | Rational fear of retaliation based on observed outcomes |
| Retaliation patterns | Predictable factors determine who gets retaliated against |
| External vs. internal | Different dynamics for reporting within vs. outside organisation |
| Legal landscape | Whistleblower protection laws and their limitations |

### What This Literature Fails to Explain

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Internal risk reporting | Literature focuses on external whistleblowing about wrongdoing; internal risk reporting is different |
| Technical/operational risk | Literature focuses on ethical/legal violations; operational/security risk discovery may differ |
| Pre-articulation suppression | Literature assumes risk is discovered and then suppression occurs; doesn't address suppression of discovery itself |
| Organisational response | Literature focuses on individual whistleblower outcomes; less on what happens to the reported risk |
| Beyond wrongdoing | Literature defines whistleblowing as reporting wrongdoing; demonstrated risk may not involve wrongdoing |

### Connection to Inhibitors

| Inhibitor | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Risk discovery as career threat | **Direct connection:** Whistleblowing research demonstrates that reporting has career costs. The gap: this work extends to *risk* discovery (not just wrongdoing) and *internal* reporting (not just external) |
| Accountability diffusion | **Indirect connection:** Retaliation research shows messenger becomes target; diffusion makes messenger the only clear target |

## Cluster 3: Normalisation of Deviance

### Key Papers

1. **Vaughan (1996)** — The Challenger launch decision (book)
2. **Turner (1978)** — Man-made disasters (book)
3. **Reason (1990)** — Human error (book)
4. **Reason (1997)** — Managing the risks of organizational accidents (book)
5. **Weick (1988)** — Enacted sensemaking in crisis situations
6. **Perrow (1984)** — Normal accidents (book)

### Central Claims

This literature establishes that:

- **Deviance becomes normalised:** Repeated acceptance of anomalies without incident creates a new baseline; what was once unacceptable becomes routine (Vaughan, 1996)
- **Disasters have long incubation periods:** Warning signs accumulate over time but are not recognised or acted upon (Turner, 1978)
- **Latent conditions combine with active failures:** Accidents result from pre-existing organisational conditions plus triggering events (Reason, 1990, 1997)
- **Sensemaking shapes response:** How organisations interpret signals determines whether they act (Weick, 1988)
- **Complexity creates inevitability:** In complex, tightly-coupled systems, accidents are "normal" — structurally inevitable (Perrow, 1984)

### What This Literature Explains Well

| Phenomenon | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Gradual drift | How acceptable boundaries shift over time without conscious decision |
| Incubation | How warning signs accumulate without triggering response |
| Post-hoc analysis | Why disasters were "predictable" only in hindsight |
| System complexity | How complexity creates unpredictable failure modes |

### What This Literature Fails to Explain

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Demonstrated vs. latent risk | Literature focuses on latent conditions and ambiguous signals; demonstrated risk is unambiguous |
| Active vs. passive ignoring | Normalisation is gradual and unconscious; some risk ignoring is active and conscious |
| Structural inhibitors | Literature identifies cultural drift; less attention to structural incentives that maintain normalisation |
| Intervention design | Literature diagnoses; less prescriptive about intervention design |
| Individual decision-making | Literature focuses on collective sensemaking; less on why individuals don't act on what they know |

### Connection to Inhibitors

| Inhibitor | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Compliance theatre | **Direct connection:** Normalisation of deviance can produce compliance theatre — documented controls that drift from reality. The gap: this work focuses on the structural mechanisms that sustain theatre, not just cultural drift |
| Accountability diffusion | **Indirect connection:** Normalisation is collective; "everybody's problem is nobody's job." The gap: this work identifies diffusion as a distinct structural pattern, not just cultural phenomenon |

## Cluster 4: Security Economics and Disclosure Incentives

### Key Papers

1. **Anderson (2001)** — Why information security is hard: An economic perspective
2. **Arora et al. (2006)** — An empirical analysis of vendor response to vulnerability disclosure
3. **Schneier (2003)** — Beyond fear (book)
4. **Florêncio & Herley (2013)** — Where do all the attacks go?
5. **Moore et al. (2010)** — The economics of online crime
6. **Ransbotham et al. (2012)** — Conflict and governance in an open-source software community

### Central Claims

This literature establishes that:

- **Security is an economic problem:** Misaligned incentives cause security failures; those who can improve security don't bear failure costs (Anderson, 2001)
- **Disclosure changes behaviour:** Public disclosure accelerates vendor patching; private disclosure delays it (Arora et al., 2006)
- **Security theatre exists:** Visible measures provide feelings of security without substance (Schneier, 2003)
- **Attack costs are distributed:** Victims bear costs while attackers reap benefits; this externality explains underinvestment (Florêncio & Herley, 2013)
- **Incentives can be designed:** Bug bounties, coordinated disclosure, and liability regimes can align incentives (Moore et al., 2010)

### What This Literature Explains Well

| Phenomenon | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Underinvestment in security | Rational given externalities and misaligned incentives |
| Disclosure dynamics | Why vendors respond differently to public vs. private disclosure |
| Security theatre | Why visible but ineffective measures persist |
| Market failures | How security as public good creates underinvestment |

### What This Literature Fails to Explain

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Internal incentives | Literature focuses on inter-organisational incentives (vendors, researchers); less on intra-organisational dynamics |
| Beyond security | Literature is security-focused; operational risk, safety risk may have different economics |
| Implementation details | Literature identifies incentive problems; less on governance design for internal processes |
| Authority structures | Literature focuses on market incentives; less on organisational authority and accountability |
| Compliance as economics | Literature treats compliance as different from security; this work sees them as economically connected |

### Connection to Inhibitors

| Inhibitor | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Compliance theatre | **Direct connection:** Security economics explains why theatre emerges (cheaper than substance). The gap: this work extends to internal compliance processes and provides governance patterns to address it |
| Responsibility without authority | **Indirect connection:** Incentive misalignment creates responsibility-authority gaps. The gap: this work focuses on internal organisational design, not market-level incentives |

## Cross-Cluster Analysis

### What Each Cluster Contributes

| Cluster | Primary Contribution | Unit of Analysis |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Psychological safety | Why individuals stay silent | Team |
| Whistleblowing | Costs of speaking up about wrongdoing | Individual-organisation |
| Normalisation of deviance | How anomalies become acceptable | Organisation-system |
| Security economics | Incentive structures for security investment | Market-organisation |

### Common Thread: Demonstrated Risk Ignored

All four literatures touch on the phenomenon of demonstrated risk being ignored, but none captures it fully:

| Cluster | What it captures | What it misses |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Psychological safety | Voice suppression | Action after voice |
| Whistleblowing | Retaliation for reporting | Internal risk (not wrongdoing) |
| Normalisation | Drift from standards | Active ignoring of demonstrated risk |
| Security economics | Incentive misalignment | Internal organisational design |

### Why No Single Literature Suffices

1. **Level of analysis:** Literatures operate at different levels (team, individual, organisation, market) without integration
2. **Type of risk:** Each focuses on different risk types (any concern, wrongdoing, latent conditions, security)
3. **Phase of problem:** Some focus on suppression (voice), some on response (normalisation), some on incentives (economics)
4. **Prescription gap:** All are better at diagnosis than intervention design
