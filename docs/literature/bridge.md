# Unifying Bridge: Why Existing Literatures Are Insufficient

## The Bridge Paragraph

Four distinct research traditions illuminate why organisations fail to act on risk, yet none captures the full phenomenon of demonstrated risk being ignored.

**Psychological safety research** (Edmondson, Morrison, Detert) explains why employees stay silent: fear, implicit theories about when speaking up is appropriate, and perceived futility suppress voice. This literature illuminates the *suppression* of risk discovery but operates primarily at the team level and does not address what happens after someone does speak up — the structural conditions that cause organisations to ignore risks even when they are clearly articulated.

**Whistleblowing research** (Miceli, Near, Rehg) documents the predictable costs of reporting wrongdoing: retaliation, career damage, and social isolation. This tradition explains why individuals rationally choose not to report, but focuses on ethical and legal violations reported externally. Internal reporting of operational or security risks — where no wrongdoing may be involved — follows different dynamics that this literature does not address.

**Normalisation of deviance research** (Vaughan, Turner, Perrow, Reason) explains how anomalies become acceptable over time: gradual drift, collective sensemaking, and system complexity create conditions where warning signs accumulate without triggering response. This literature excels at post-hoc analysis of disasters but focuses on latent conditions and ambiguous signals. Demonstrated risk — unambiguous, reproduced, communicated — is a different phenomenon: not a subtle warning sign requiring interpretation, but clear evidence that something is wrong.

**Security economics research** (Anderson, Arora, Schneier) provides the incentive lens: misaligned incentives cause security failures, security theatre persists because it is cheaper than substance, and disclosure dynamics affect vendor behaviour. This literature operates primarily at market level (vendors, researchers, attackers) and offers less guidance on internal organisational design — how to structure authority, accountability, and processes so that demonstrated risks cannot be ignored.

**What unifies these literatures is a common thread: demonstrated risk being ignored.** Each tradition touches on this phenomenon from its own angle — suppressed voice, retaliation fear, normalised deviance, misaligned incentives — but none integrates them into a unified model of how risk flows through organisations and where it stalls.

**The gap this work fills is integration and operationalisation.** By synthesising insights from all four traditions into a socio-technical model of truth flow — with identifiable structural inhibitors at each stage of the pipeline — this work provides:

1. A **unified explanation** of why ignoring demonstrated risk is locally rational for individual actors, even when globally harmful
2. An **operational taxonomy** of structural inhibitors that can be reliably identified and coded across cases
3. **Governance intervention patterns** that target specific inhibitors and can be implemented by practitioners

Existing literatures describe pieces of the problem. This work integrates them into a model designed for practical intervention.

## How This Paragraph Positions in a Paper

This bridge paragraph would appear:

- **After** the related work section that summarises each literature cluster
- **Before** the model/framework section that introduces the truth flow pipeline and inhibitors
- **Function:** Transitions from "what others have said" to "what we contribute"

The paragraph:
- Acknowledges what each literature contributes (no strawmanning)
- Identifies the common thread (demonstrated risk ignored)
- Explains why no single literature captures the full phenomenon
- Motivates the unified socio-technical model

## Extended Bridge (Optional)

For contexts requiring more detail, the bridge can be expanded:

### The Gap in Level of Analysis

Each literature operates at a different level — team, individual-organisation, organisation-system, market — without integration across levels. Psychological safety research helps managers build safer teams but doesn't address what happens when safe teams surface risks to unsafe organisations. Whistleblowing research helps individuals calculate reporting costs but doesn't design organisations where reporting is rational. Normalisation research helps investigators explain disasters but doesn't give leaders tools to prevent drift. Security economics research helps policymakers design disclosure regimes but doesn't help CISOs design internal governance.

A unified model must span levels: from individual discoverer, through team and management, to executive decision-making, and back to outcome. The truth flow pipeline in this work provides that integration.

### The Gap in Risk Type

Each literature focuses on different types of concerns: psychological safety on any concern, whistleblowing on wrongdoing, normalisation on latent conditions, security economics on technical vulnerabilities. Demonstrated risk — a known, reproduced, communicated threat to organisational objectives — may not involve wrongdoing, may not be latent or ambiguous, and may not fit into technical vulnerability categories.

A unified model must address demonstrated risk specifically: risk that meets operational criteria (reproducible, severe, communicable) and should trigger response. The operational definition in this work provides that specificity.

### The Gap in Prescription

All four literatures are stronger in diagnosis than prescription. Psychological safety research recommends "leader behaviours" without governance design. Whistleblowing research recommends "protection mechanisms" without implementation specifics. Normalisation research recommends "high reliability culture" without structural interventions. Security economics research recommends "aligned incentives" without organisational design.

A unified model must translate insight into implementable intervention. The governance patterns in this work provide that translation: specific mechanisms (mandatory response triggers, protected discovery, empirical validation requirements, executive risk acceptance ownership) that target identified inhibitors at identified pipeline stages.
