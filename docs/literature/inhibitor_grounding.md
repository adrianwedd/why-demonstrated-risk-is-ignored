This document grounds each structural inhibitor in established research literature. For each inhibitor:

1. **Cornerstone citations** — foundational works that establish the theoretical basis
2. **What each citation explains** — the specific contribution
3. **What each citation does NOT explain** — the gap this work addresses
4. **Tensions between sources** — where the literature disagrees

## Inhibitor 1: Responsibility Without Authority

### Cornerstone Citations

#### 1.1 Jensen & Meckling (1976) — Theory of the Firm

**Citation:** Jensen, M.C., & Meckling, W.H. (1976). Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure. *Journal of Financial Economics*, 3(4), 305-360.

**What it explains:**
- Principal-agent problems arise when agents (managers, employees) have different incentives than principals (owners, executives)
- Information asymmetries create opportunities for agents to pursue self-interest
- Monitoring costs and bonding costs are incurred to align agent behaviour with principal interests

**What it does NOT explain:**
- The *specific* dynamic where risk responsibility is assigned without commensurate authority
- How this manifests in risk management contexts (vs. general agency problems)
- The moral injury dimension when agents are blamed for outcomes they cannot control

**Gap this work fills:** Applies principal-agent theory specifically to risk management roles, identifying responsibility-authority separation as a distinct structural inhibitor.

#### 1.2 Galbraith (1974) — Organisation Design

**Citation:** Galbraith, J.R. (1974). Organization design: An information processing view. *Interfaces*, 4(3), 28-36.

**What it explains:**
- Organisations process information; design should match information processing capacity to task uncertainty
- Lateral relations, slack resources, and vertical information systems are mechanisms to handle coordination
- Authority structures should align with information flow requirements

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How risk-specific information processing fails when authority structures are misaligned
- Why organisations persist in creating advisory-only risk functions despite coordination failures
- The specific artifacts (ticket queues, escalation dead-ends) that indicate this failure mode

**Gap this work fills:** Operationalises information-processing theory into observable tells for diagnosing responsibility-authority mismatch in risk contexts.

---

#### 1.3 Mintzberg (1979) — The Structuring of Organisations

**Citation:** Mintzberg, H. (1979). *The Structuring of Organizations: A Synthesis of the Research*. Prentice-Hall.

**What it explains:**
- Coordination mechanisms: mutual adjustment, direct supervision, standardisation of work/output/skills
- Configuration archetypes (simple structure, machine bureaucracy, professional bureaucracy, etc.)
- Technostructure (analysts who design and plan) vs. operating core

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How risk functions fit into these configurations when they have responsibility without line authority
- The specific failure mode where risk staff cannot compel action from operating core
- How "dotted line" reporting relationships systematically fail for demonstrated risk

**Gap this work fills:** Identifies risk functions as a hybrid technostructure role that requires authority atypical of the archetype, creating predictable structural failure.

---

#### 1.4 Perrow (1984) — Normal Accidents

**Citation:** Perrow, C. (1984). *Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies*. Basic Books.

**What it explains:**
- Complex, tightly-coupled systems produce accidents that are "normal" (inevitable given the system properties)
- Interactive complexity makes failures unpredictable; tight coupling makes them cascade
- Organisation design cannot eliminate accidents in such systems, only manage frequency and consequence

**What it does NOT explain:**
- The specific organisational mechanisms by which *known* risks are ignored (focuses on unpredictable failures)
- How authority structures contribute to ignoring *demonstrated* (not just latent) risks
- The role of risk ownership design in creating or preventing normal accidents

**Gap this work fills:** Extends normal accident theory to show how structural inhibitors make *predictable* failures go unaddressed, not just *unpredictable* ones.

---

### Tensions Between Sources

| Tension | Sources | This work's position |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Can design eliminate failures? | Perrow (sceptical) vs. Galbraith (optimistic) | Design cannot eliminate failures but can remove structural inhibitors that cause predictable ones |
| Are advisory roles valuable? | Mintzberg (technostructure adds value) vs. this analysis (advisory-only creates failure) | Advisory roles add value only when paired with decision-forcing mechanisms |

## Inhibitor 2: Risk Discovery as Career Threat

### Cornerstone Citations

#### 2.1 Edmondson (1999) — Psychological Safety

**Citation:** Edmondson, A. (1999). Psychological safety and learning behavior in work teams. *Administrative Science Quarterly*, 44(2), 350-383.

**What it explains:**
- Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking
- Teams with higher psychological safety show more learning behaviour (asking questions, admitting errors, seeking feedback)
- Psychological safety is distinct from group cohesiveness or trust

**What it does NOT explain:**
- The specific career dynamics that suppress risk reporting (vs. general interpersonal risk)
- How organisations create structural disincentives for risk discovery beyond team-level culture
- The "messenger association" phenomenon where discoverers are blamed for the problems they find

**Gap this work fills:** Identifies career-level structural disincentives (not just team-level psychological safety) as a distinct inhibitor.

---

#### 2.2 Miceli & Near (1992) — Whistleblowing

**Citation:** Miceli, M.P., & Near, J.P. (1992). *Blowing the Whistle: The Organizational and Legal Implications for Companies and Employees*. Lexington Books.

**What it explains:**
- Whistleblowers face retaliation in predictable patterns (termination, demotion, isolation)
- Organisational factors (wrongdoing severity, evidence strength, power of wrongdoer) predict retaliation likelihood
- Legal protections are often insufficient to prevent or remedy retaliation

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How retaliation dynamics apply to *internal* risk reporting (not just external whistleblowing)
- The subtle career costs of raising concerns that don't rise to whistleblowing level
- How organisations create pre-emptive chilling effects that suppress discovery before articulation

**Gap this work fills:** Extends whistleblowing research to internal risk discovery, identifying the career threat dynamic for demonstrated (not just ethical) concerns.

---

#### 2.3 Detert & Edmondson (2011) — Implicit Voice Theories

**Citation:** Detert, J.R., & Edmondson, A.C. (2011). Implicit voice theories: Taken-for-granted rules of self-censorship at work. *Academy of Management Journal*, 54(3), 461-488.

**What it explains:**
- Employees hold "implicit voice theories" — beliefs about when speaking up is appropriate or risky
- Five theories identified: presumed target identification, need solid data, don't bypass, don't embarrass, negativity is risky
- These theories lead to self-censorship even when explicit sanctions are absent

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How implicit voice theories interact with structural incentives (performance rewards tied to project success)
- The specific risk discovery context where implicit theories are reinforced by observable retaliation
- How organisations could design systems that override negative implicit voice theories

**Gap this work fills:** Connects implicit voice theories to observable structural features (no safe channel, incentives for silence) that reinforce self-censorship in risk contexts.

---

#### 2.4 Kish-Gephart et al. (2009) — Organisational Silence

**Citation:** Kish-Gephart, J.J., Detert, J.R., Treviño, L.K., & Edmondson, A.C. (2009). Silenced by fear: The nature, sources, and consequences of fear at work. *Research in Organizational Behavior*, 29, 163-193.

**What it explains:**
- Fear at work has multiple sources: interpersonal, job loss, social rejection, punishment
- Fear leads to silence, which has negative consequences for organisations (reduced innovation, hidden problems)
- Both dispositional and situational factors contribute to workplace fear

**What it does NOT explain:**
- The specific career threat mechanism for risk discoverers (beyond general workplace fear)
- How fear manifests differently in risk/security roles vs. general employees
- The rational calculus that makes silence the optimal strategy for risk discoverers

**Gap this work fills:** Identifies risk discovery as a specific domain where fear-based silence is structurally reinforced, not just culturally present.

---

### Tensions Between Sources

| Tension | Sources | This work's position |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Is silence irrational? | Edmondson (silence is suboptimal learning behaviour) vs. Miceli/Near (silence is rational given retaliation) | Silence is locally rational but globally harmful; structure, not culture, must change |
| Can psychological safety alone fix this? | Edmondson (team-level safety enables voice) vs. this analysis (career-level incentives override team safety) | Psychological safety is necessary but insufficient; career protection mechanisms required |

## Inhibitor 3: Compliance Theatre

### Cornerstone Citations

#### 3.1 Anderson (2001) — Why Information Security is Hard

**Citation:** Anderson, R. (2001). Why information security is hard — an economic perspective. *Proceedings of the 17th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference*.

**What it explains:**
- Information security is an economic problem, not just a technical one
- Misaligned incentives cause security failures: those who can improve security don't bear the costs of failure
- "Security economics" provides a lens for understanding why rational actors under-invest in security

**What it does NOT explain:**
- The specific mechanism of assurance substitution (documents replacing empirical validation)
- Why certification and compliance frameworks persist despite economic critique
- How compliance theatre specifically causes *demonstrated* risks to be ignored

**Gap this work fills:** Identifies compliance theatre as the specific manifestation of misaligned incentives in assurance contexts.

---

#### 3.2 Power (1997) — The Audit Society

**Citation:** Power, M. (1997). *The Audit Society: Rituals of Verification*. Oxford University Press.

**What it explains:**
- Modern organisations are subject to extensive auditing and verification demands
- Audit creates its own reality: organisations adapt to be auditable, not necessarily effective
- "Audit explosion" leads to ritualised compliance rather than substantive assurance

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How audit ritualisation specifically manifests in security/risk contexts
- The observable tells that distinguish theatre from substance
- How organisations could break the theatre cycle while satisfying external audit demands

**Gap this work fills:** Operationalises audit society critique into codable tells for compliance theatre in risk management.

---

#### 3.3 Schneier (2003) — Beyond Fear

**Citation:** Schneier, B. (2003). *Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World*. Copernicus Books.

**What it explains:**
- Security theatre: visible measures that provide feeling of security without substance
- Trade-offs in security: cost, risk reduction, effectiveness, side effects
- Laypeople and experts assess security differently; theatre exploits this gap

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How security theatre becomes institutionalised in compliance frameworks
- The organisational dynamics that sustain theatre even when insiders know it's insufficient
- How to distinguish theatre from legitimate assurance activities

**Gap this work fills:** Extends security theatre concept from public-facing measures to internal compliance processes.

---

#### 3.4 Arora et al. (2006) — Empirical Study of Software Security

**Citation:** Arora, A., Krishnan, R., Telang, R., & Yang, Y. (2006). An empirical analysis of vendor response to vulnerability disclosure. *Workshop on the Economics of Information Security*.

**What it explains:**
- Vendors respond to disclosed vulnerabilities based on economic incentives, not just severity
- Public disclosure accelerates patching; private disclosure delays it
- Market structure affects security investment and response timing

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How internal organisations respond to demonstrated (not publicly disclosed) risks
- The compliance vs. empirical validation dynamic within organisations
- Why organisations invest in attestation over testing

**Gap this work fills:** Applies security economics to internal risk management, showing how compliance incentives diverge from empirical validation incentives.

---

### Tensions Between Sources

| Tension | Sources | This work's position |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Is compliance always theatre? | Power (critical of audit culture) vs. practitioners (compliance serves real purposes) | Compliance becomes theatre when it substitutes for empirical validation, not when it complements it |
| Can external standards fix this? | Schneier (sceptical of certifications) vs. industry practice (standards as baseline) | Standards can reduce theatre if tied to empirical verification, not just documentary attestation |

## Inhibitor 4: Accountability Diffusion

### Cornerstone Citations

#### 4.1 Darley & Latané (1968) — Bystander Effect

**Citation:** Darley, J.M., & Latané, B. (1968). Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 8(4), 377-383.

**What it explains:**
- Diffusion of responsibility: the presence of others reduces individual sense of responsibility
- In emergencies, bystanders fail to intervene when others are present
- The effect is robust across experimental settings

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How diffusion of responsibility operates in organisational (not emergency) contexts
- The specific mechanisms by which committee structures diffuse accountability
- How diffusion interacts with formal RACI assignments

**Gap this work fills:** Extends bystander effect to organisational risk decisions, showing how formal structures create diffusion even with assigned responsibilities.

---

#### 4.2 Janis (1972) — Groupthink

**Citation:** Janis, I.L. (1972). *Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes*. Houghton Mifflin.

**What it explains:**
- Cohesive groups can make poor decisions due to pressure for unanimity
- Groupthink symptoms: illusion of invulnerability, collective rationalisation, stereotyping outgroups
- Defective decision-making: incomplete survey of alternatives, failure to examine risks

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How groupthink relates to formal accountability structures (RACI, committees)
- The difference between groupthink (consensus on bad decision) and accountability diffusion (no decision at all)
- How to design committees that avoid both groupthink and diffusion

**Gap this work fills:** Distinguishes groupthink (consensus failure) from accountability diffusion (ownership failure) as separate inhibitor mechanisms.

---

#### 4.3 Katzenbach & Smith (1993) — The Wisdom of Teams

**Citation:** Katzenbach, J.R., & Smith, D.K. (1993). *The Wisdom of Teams: Creating the High-Performance Organization*. Harvard Business School Press.

**What it explains:**
- Effective teams have clear purpose, performance goals, and mutual accountability
- "Working groups" (vs. teams) rely on individual contributions without collective accountability
- Team effectiveness depends on discipline: size, skills, purpose, goals, approach, accountability

**What it does NOT explain:**
- How "mutual accountability" can mask individual accountability gaps
- The specific failure mode where committees have shared responsibility and no individual ownership
- How to design risk governance that maintains individual accountability while enabling collaboration

**Gap this work fills:** Identifies the failure mode where team structures (designed for collaboration) are misapplied to accountability decisions, creating diffusion.

---

#### 4.4 Clegg, Kornberger & Pitsis (2015) — Managing and Organizations

**Citation:** Clegg, S.R., Kornberger, M., & Pitsis, T. (2015). *Managing and Organizations: An Introduction to Theory and Practice*. SAGE.

**What it explains:**
- Organisational decision-making involves formal and informal processes
- Rational models of decision-making (problem definition → alternatives → choice) rarely match reality
- Political models: decisions emerge from negotiation among stakeholders with different interests

**What it does NOT explain:**
- The specific mechanism by which risk decisions stall in committee structures
- How RACI frameworks fail when accountability is shared
- The observable artifacts (meeting minutes without decisions, referral chains) that indicate diffusion

**Gap this work fills:** Operationalises organisational decision theory into codable tells for accountability diffusion in risk governance.

---

### Tensions Between Sources

| Tension | Sources | This work's position |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Are teams good for risk decisions? | Katzenbach/Smith (teams can be effective) vs. Janis (groups make bad decisions) | Teams can be effective for implementation; risk *decisions* require individual accountability |
| Is diffusion intentional? | Political models (diffusion serves interests) vs. bystander effect (diffusion is emergent) | Both: diffusion is often emergent but is sustained because it serves political purposes |

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Structure vs. Culture

The literature spans structural and cultural explanations. This work privileges structural factors because:

- Structural features are more observable and codable than cultural ones
- Structural interventions are more tractable than cultural change
- Culture may be downstream of structure (change incentives, behaviour follows)

### Theme 2: Individual vs. System

The literature debates whether failures are individual (bad actors, poor judgment) or systemic (inevitable given structures). This work takes the systemic view:

- Individual explanations lead to blame; systemic explanations lead to design
- The same individuals behave differently in different structures
- Inhibitors are structural features, not individual failings

### Theme 3: Rational vs. Irrational

The literature debates whether failures are rational responses to incentives or irrational biases. This work synthesises:

- Ignoring risk is *locally* rational (for the individual actor)
- Ignoring risk is *globally* irrational (for the organisation)
- Structural interventions must change local incentives to align with global outcomes
