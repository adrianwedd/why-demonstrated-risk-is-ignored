# PhD Research Proposal: Engineering Truth in Socio-Technical Systems
*Draft derived from canonical v1.0 (read:

## Summary
This proposal investigates why large organisations often fail to act on
demonstrated risk, even when evidence is clear and communicated through approved
channels. It treats institutional inaction as an outcome of system design:
misaligned authority, incentives that punish risk discovery, compliance
substituting for empirical validation, and diffuse accountability.

## Motivation
Across safety- and security-critical domains, the gap between “known risk” and
“acted-on risk” is a recurring failure mode. Understanding and redesigning the
structures that govern attention, prioritisation, and accountability is relevant
to both conventional governance and emerging AI safety and assurance practices.

## Research Questions
- What structural conditions make acting on demonstrated risk locally rational
  or locally costly?
- How do escalation pathways, accountability structures, and incentive regimes
  affect remediation outcomes?
- What interventions measurably increase the probability that demonstrated risk
  results in action without creating perverse incentives?

## Proposed Approach
- **Conceptual model:** formalise “truth flow” as a socio-technical pipeline
  constrained by decision rights, incentives, and organisational liability.
- **Empirical work:** qualitative interviews and document analysis across
  regulated organisations; optional case studies where access permits.
- **Intervention design:** define and test lightweight governance patterns (e.g.
  time-bounded escalation, outcome ownership, and empirical control validation).
- **Evaluation:** pre/post measures such as time-to-remediation for demonstrated
  findings, escalation outcomes, and perceived psychological safety among roles
  responsible for surfacing risk.

## Expected Contributions
- A grounded explanatory model for why demonstrated risk is ignored.
- A catalogue of design interventions with predicted trade-offs.
- Evaluation guidance for organisations attempting to increase “truth mobility”
  without increasing fear, blame, or performative compliance.

## Ethics and Safety Considerations
This work concerns organisational harm dynamics. Study design will prioritise
participant safety, anonymisation, and minimisation of institutional risk while
avoiding dilution of structural findings.
