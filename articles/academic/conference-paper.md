## Abstract
Large organisations frequently fail to act on demonstrated risk even when
evidence is clear, reproducible, and communicated through accepted governance
channels. This paper argues that such failures are often locally rational
outcomes of system design: responsibility is separated from authority, risk
discovery creates personal and institutional exposure, compliance artefacts
substitute for empirical validation, and accountability diffuses across complex
structures. We propose a socio-technical model in which “truth” behaves like a
force encountering organisational constraints, and we outline design
interventions that increase the probability that demonstrated risk results in
action. These interventions include aligning decision rights with
responsibility, instituting protected escalation pathways with time bounds,
requiring empirical tests of controls, and assigning explicit outcome ownership.
We discuss expected trade-offs (liability, reputational concerns, and workload),
and propose evaluation approaches suitable for regulated environments.

## Introduction
Many governance models implicitly assume a linear flow from discovery to action:
identify risk, present evidence, and decision-makers remediate. Yet practitioners
often report a consistent pattern: proven risk is acknowledged without movement.
This paper treats that pattern as a design problem rather than a communication
failure.

## Problem Framing
We define **demonstrated risk** as a risk supported by direct evidence (e.g.,
reproducible vulnerability, incident replay, or measured control failure). The
key observation is not that organisations lack risk registers, but that
demonstration alone is frequently insufficient to change priorities.

## Structural Inhibitors

### Responsibility without authority
Risk discovery is commonly delegated to roles without budget or roadmap control.
Evidence becomes an input to a queue rather than a trigger for decision-making.

### Risk discovery as exposure
Demonstration can threaten reputations and prior decisions. Where speaking up is
career-limiting, silence is reinforced as rational behaviour.

### Compliance artefacts displacing reality
Assurance work often optimises for documents rather than verified outcomes.
Without adversarial or empirical validation, “controls” can exist socially while
failing materially.

### Diffuse accountability
Complex committees distribute responsibility such that no single actor is
required to own remediation outcomes, reducing the probability of action.

## Related Work
This argument connects to research on psychological safety and learning in teams,
employee voice and silence, whistleblowing dynamics, normalisation of deviance
in complex organisations, and security economics around disclosure incentives.
These bodies of work collectively support the claim that truth-telling is shaped
by incentives and structure, not simply by individual ethics.

## Design Interventions
We propose interventions aimed at making action structurally easier than
inaction:

- Align remediation authority with responsibility (decision rights, budgets, and
  time).
- Provide protected escalation paths with clear time bounds and non-retaliation
  norms that are enforced, not merely stated.
- Require empirical validation for high-impact controls (testing, exercises,
  adversarial review) alongside compliance artefacts.
- Assign named ownership for outcomes, and measure closure in terms of reduced
  exposure rather than ticket throughput.

## Conclusion
When organisational structure makes ignoring demonstrated risk the least painful
option, evidence will not reliably produce action. Redesigning authority,
accountability, and validation practices can turn demonstrated truth into
movement.
