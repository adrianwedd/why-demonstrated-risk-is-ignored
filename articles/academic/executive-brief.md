# Executive Brief: Why Demonstrated Risk Is Ignored (and How to Fix It)
*One-page brief derived from canonical v1.0 (read:

## Executive Summary
Large organisations often acknowledge proven risk without acting on it. This is
rarely a failure of intelligence or communication. It is typically a predictable
outcome of structure: incentives, authority, and accountability make inaction
the least painful option.

## What’s Happening (in plain terms)
- People who find risk often lack the authority to fix it (budget, roadmap, or
  decision rights).
- Demonstrating risk can increase institutional exposure (liability,
  reputational harm), creating an incentive to delay or contain.
- Compliance artefacts can substitute for empirical verification of safety.
- Accountability diffuses across committees and handoffs, so nobody owns the
  outcome.

## What To Change (design interventions)
- **Align authority with responsibility:** if a role is accountable for risk,
  give it decision rights and time/budget to remediate or escalate.
- **Make escalation safe and time-bounded:** define who must respond, by when,
  and what happens if they do not.
- **Require empirical validation:** high-impact controls should be tested, not
  only documented (exercises, adversarial review, incident replay).
- **Assign outcome ownership:** name an owner for remediation outcomes, not just
  process steps or ticket queues.
- **Reward surfacing risk:** treat demonstrated risk discovery as value creation,
  not exposure creation.

## First 30 Days (practical starter set)
- Pick 1–2 high-impact risks and run an end-to-end “truth pipeline” exercise:
  demonstrate, escalate, decide, remediate, verify.
- Define a single escalation path with response deadlines and a documented
  fallback decision-maker.
- Add one empirical test requirement for a critical control (and publish the
  results internally).

## What Success Looks Like
- Demonstrated findings reliably produce a decision (fix, accept, or defer with
  a named owner and review date).
- People can surface risk without career damage.
- “We have a policy” is no longer treated as evidence of safety.
